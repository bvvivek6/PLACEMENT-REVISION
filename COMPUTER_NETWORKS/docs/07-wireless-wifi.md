# Wireless: Wi‑Fi basics

Wireless behaves differently from Ethernet because the medium is shared and unreliable.

## Key idea: shared air

- Devices contend for airtime.
- Interference, distance, walls impact signal quality.

## 2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz (intuition)

- 2.4 GHz: longer range, more interference, fewer non-overlapping channels
- 5 GHz: more channels, often faster, shorter range

## Throughput vs signal quality

Even if your “link speed” looks high, real throughput depends on:

- retransmissions due to errors
- contention with other devices
- channel width and noise

## Interview questions

1. Why is Wi‑Fi throughput often lower than the reported link rate?
2. Why might 2.4 GHz reach farther than 5 GHz?
