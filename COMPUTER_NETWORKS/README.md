# Computer Networks (Interview + Fundamentals)

A structured, example-driven repository covering the most important Computer Networks concepts for interviews and practical understanding.

## How to use this repo

- **Fast revision (1–2 hours):** Start with [cheatsheets/NETWORKING_INTERVIEW_CHEATSHEET.md](cheatsheets/NETWORKING_INTERVIEW_CHEATSHEET.md)
- **Concepts with examples:** Follow the docs in order (each file ends with interview questions).

## Table of contents

4. [Transport: UDP vs TCP, reliability, congestion](docs/04-transport-tcp-udp.md)
5. [Application: DNS, HTTP, TLS](docs/05-application-dns-http-tls.md)
6. [Routing & switching basics: RIP/OSPF/BGP, switching](docs/06-routing-switching.md)
7. [Wireless & mobile: Wi‑Fi basics](docs/07-wireless-wifi.md)
8. [Security: common attacks + defenses](docs/08-security.md)
9. [Performance: latency, throughput, buffering, QoS](docs/09-performance.md)
10. [Troubleshooting: tools + mental model](docs/10-troubleshooting-tools.md)

### Interview prep

- [Networking Interview Cheat Sheet](cheatsheets/NETWORKING_INTERVIEW_CHEATSHEET.md)
- [Scenario Q&A](cheatsheets/SCENARIO_QA.md)

## What you’ll learn

- How packets move hop-by-hop (ARP → IP routing → TCP/UDP → app protocols)
- Why TCP behaves the way it does (handshake, retransmits, congestion control)
- How DNS + HTTP + TLS interact in real-world web traffic
- How to debug network issues systematically

## Contributing

PRs are welcome for improvements, diagrams, or more examples. Keep content:

- Correct and example-driven
- Focused on fundamentals (avoid vendor-specific features unless clearly labeled)
